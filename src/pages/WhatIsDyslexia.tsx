              Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulties with accurate and fluent word recognition, spelling, and decoding abilities. It affects how the brain processes language and is not related to intelligence or vision problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Approximately 15-20% of the population exhibits some symptoms of dyslexia. It is a neurological condition that is often hereditary and exists on a spectrum, meaning individuals can experience it in different ways and to varying degrees.

              Dyslexia can present differently from person to person, but there are some common signs to watch for at different ages. It's important to note that having some of these signs doesn't necessarily mean someone has dyslexia.

                  Research using brain imaging has shown that people with dyslexia process information differently. Areas of the brain typically associated with reading and language processing show different patterns of activity.

              It's important to understand that the dyslexic brain is not "broken"â€”it's simply wired differently. Many people with dyslexia have exceptional abilities in areas such as three-dimensional thinking, problem-solving, and creative fields.
